The files in here should be run from one directory *above*.

That is:

cd ~/collab/code/
sh -x ugrads-as-cluster/scriptname.sh

The script depends on these facts:

~/dnet/machines - a list of machines you can SSH to
~/bin/bogosort - ESR's bogosort program
~/bin/7za - a binary of p7zip
paulproteus@fomalhaut.acm.jhu.edu is the machine that holds 7z files that we will decompress on use
/mnt/paul/space/ on fomalhaut is where these files are stored

Configuration:

PROJECT - the name of the directory where results and chat will be stored
JOBWAIT - expected time to completion of one job; not necessary, but recommended

-- Asheesh.
