Done:

* Come to terms with the immensity of the data

---
Jobs to run:

* For each 7z file, extract revision index
* (IN PROGRESS) For each 7z file, extract title index
* Given title and revision indices, combine them

* Draw a nice histogram of revisions per article

---

Data to analyze:

* What do the matchedsentences look like?
* Is "styleedits.7z" plausible?

--

Clean up better after explosions.

* Look into explosions involving perl...
* Look into \0-related explosions...?

Northup suggests:

An animation that takes one revision and makes an animation of keys being pressed to make the changes in WP

expand jargon as it gets replaeced


== RIGHT NOW ==

* I want ID display in the HTML version
* pulldom?
* or real dom?
* or just CSS on output file?  That'd be great.



Before meeting:

* CSS output file (20m)
* Look through one or two more and note edit types (20-30m)

* Do we care about capitalization fixes?
** Probably.  They're style for sure.
** What are we evaluating?  How about answering the question of, "Does WP style improve?"

* Pref make a program to identify one type of changes
* spel fixes:
** Not the same as "word-local change"
** "many of them no communistic"? <- language model might help
** 
 
** some spel fixes aren't complete - they leave non-words behind
* I won't know every word, anyway
* toa -> to a

* look for high word-based edit distance but the sentence having the
same words (except perhaps stemming - in styleedits)
