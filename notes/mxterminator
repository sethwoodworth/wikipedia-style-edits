Its license sucks.  Plus, there's no source available.

It prints each sentence from the input as a separate line on the output.

It has no in-built notion of "sections" or paragraphs.

It seems to tokenize the input on \s and strip all whitespace and put one space between words.

Q. Unicode?  Utf-8 input?
